      description: "[Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/users/sasha-klein) is an online web-development apprenticeship that turns students into well-versed developers over the course of 2-3 intensive months. I learned **Ruby**, **Rails**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Git**, **RSpec**, **Javascript/JQuery**, and more. The mentor-guided learning is focused through, and culminates in, a final project of our own design; mine morphed into [MeatUp](/portfolio#meatup). Bloc got my developing feet wet and helped teach me how to teach myself to tackle any coding obstacle thrown my way."

My four years at Harvard instilled in me a broad excitement about learning and growth that I've continued to apply to teaching myself. The bulk of my coding expertise has been self-taught, and I largely credit college with turning me into a voracious autodidact."
