I learned **Ruby**, **Rails**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Git**, **RSpec**, **Javascript/JQuery**, and more. The mentor-guided learning is focused through, and culminates in, a final project of our own design; mine morphed into [MeatUp](/portfolio#meatup). Bloc got my developing feet wet and helped teach me how to teach myself to tackle any coding obstacle thrown my way.',
