This past week, for October Holiday, three friends and I headed off to see Yellow Mountain, or Huangshan (黄山). It was truly incredible. Yellow Mountain is actually a mountain range, located in the Anhui province of China, which includes a number of separate peaks. The three days I spent there were at once completely different from any other experience I have had in nature, and completely, viscerally familiar.

Yellow Mountain seems so different because it is. Unlike other mountains I’ve been to, almost every ascent is near-vertical. Most of the rock faces are a smooth, pale yellow granite, and most of the trees are not the vertical aspen and spruce I am accustomed to seeing on Colorado mountains, but rather the gnarled and bonsai-looking Huangshan pine local to the region. More noticeably, although Huangshan is relatively low, with a highest peak that reaches less than 2000 meters above sea level, something about its unique geography traps clouds and pushes them downward, so that even when one stands at 1800 meters (roughly 6000 feet), one can look down on the skies.

This effect has brought Huangshan its fame and made the mountain range the inspiration not only for countless classic Chinese landscape paintings (I’m sure you’ve all seen one of these, in a P.F. Chang’s somewhere), but also, it is said, for the floating mountains in Avatar. These two associations, I think, are responsible for why the mountain range seemed so incredibly familiar. Standing near the edge of a vast, misty precipice, I more than once expected to see watch one of those blue-green Avatar birds soar out from some nearby peak -- which would have been convenient, because I have trouble imagining a more beautiful place to fly.

At any rate, as Huangshan is a site and is best seen, rather than just read about, I’ll wrap up the text and just give you (lots of) photos. If you’re interested in seeing more (and higher quality) photographs, I’ll shortly upload some to a Google Album.

After 5.5 hours of bus riding, we arrived in Tunxi, an Anhui town about an hour’s drive from Huangshan proper, which was itself 20 minutes by bus from the base of the mountain. The “Old Street” (Lao Jie) of the city is crowded throughout the day, but when we left to catch a bus at 6am, it was quiet and picturesque.

Because we could only reserve a tent on the mountain for the second night, we spent our first day visiting two nearby towns, Hongcun and Xidi, famed for their classical architecture and serenity. I loved the colors and textures in the Hongcun town square. It was beautiful in a very muted, calm way, and I felt everything matched remarkably well with the hair color and backpack pattern of the woman pictured center.

Like the previous photo, this one and the two that follow are from Hongcun (pronounced 'Hong tsoon,' by the way, for those wondering). Note all the people putting the lie to the claims of serenity. To be fair, we also ruined the serenity. The four of us visited the two towns as part of a large Chinese tour group (bundled prices; free lunch), which we ditched upon entering each village, because of the irreconcilable language gap and a hopeless desire to feel as though we were off the beaten path.

The Chinese Paul Bunyun, or George Washington, or something. These toy axes were all around the gift shops in Hongcun, for whatever reason.

This old woman sitting next to her wall of popularity-confirming representations of herself reminded me of David Foster Wallace’s discussion of the Most Photographed Barn in Don Delillo’s White Noise. (If interested, check DFW’s brilliant essay E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction. Even if not interested, give it a look. It’s incredible.) On a less English-major note, I took the shot because she just looked so fascinating. This woman should be pictured next to the definition of “weathered.”

The Chinese are world leaders at amusingly-posed photographs. Although best known for the unsmiling-peace-sign shot, Chinese tourists in the motherland are not afraid to shake things up by striking some truly inventive poses. This was one of the best ones I was fast enough to catch, in front of the Xidi ('Shee Dee') gate.

When we finally arrived at the base of the mountain, our wait was far from over. Getting onto the mountain involved paying 250 kuai (about 60 USD) for entrance, shelling another 80 kuai for the cable car, and then “waiting” in “line” no less than 3 hours to get a car up. The red and yellow hats (sort of crosses between baseball caps and fedoras) indicate which tour group you belong to. While in line, we watched a man sporting a pink Hello Kitty backpack get dragged away by the police for punching another man in the face. We suspect it may have had to do with an accidental half-trampling of Hello Kitty’s daughter, as such things tend to happen in “lines” here.

Once on the mountain, we encountered mist. Lots of it. Although this did not stop me from taking pictures, it stopped most of the pictures from being particularly good. If you want more mist shots, take a look at that soon-to-be-uploaded Google Album. Luckily, the next day’s weather was perfect, so most of my photos are a good deal more colorful and bright.

Huangshan hiking is not for the faint of heart. There are some seriously steep and long ascents. But just in case you were feeling good about yourself for making it up one of the longer staircases, these guys are all over the mountain to make you feel like a wimp. They run up and down at twice the pace you can muster, carrying 50 kilos of eggplant and noodles while shouting what sounds like “Way! Way! Way!” to send people scrambling out of their wide and destructive-looking paths.

The signage on the mountain was truly phenomenal. In addition to this one, with its lewd unintentional implications, there were a number of signs demanding that tourists behave like “civilized people," several telling people (with an implicit sigh of resignation) to “Stop climbing the [damn] cliffs,” and a number which talked about how fun fish are or just waxed poetic about beauty in general.

Our night on the mountain was spent outside. There are a number of hotels on Huangshan, but they were both extortionately priced and fully booked, so we rented two tents through our hostel and camped out. As she helped us rent them, Rielly, the very nice concierge at our hostel, laughed at us and called us “totally crazy,” warning us we’d freeze and not be able to all fit inside one two-person tent. We eventually caved and rented two. The largest tent-park, where we stayed, was in front of a hotel near one of the cable-car stops, and by the time we went to sleep, it was, indeed, hovering around zero degrees Celsius. We ended up ditching our second tent and cramming into a single one for body heat, where we all struggled to find room for our arms and awoke 6 hours later, having produced and all caught a cold.

The uncomfortable and hardly hygienic night (apparently, the sheets we slept in are never cleaned) was entirely worth it. We woke at 4am and sprinted up a mile or two of stairs in the dark morning air to get in a good position to watch the sunrise. Unfortunately, much of the rest of the mountain seemed to have woken at 3:30 with similar plans, and finding a good spot involved lots of jostling and eventually sitting on the edge of a 1000-foot drop. Luckily, neither my friend Noah nor I died. But we did have lots of time before the sun actually rose, which we spent trying to steady our cameras enough to take semi-crisp photos in the pre-morning non-light.

As the sun continued to take its time rising (and as my fingers continued to freeze) I swiveled around on my precipice of near-death and took a couple shots in the much less popular opposite direction, which, like everything else on Huangshan, also looked pretty incredible.

![image](https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lspfqgWGbE1qmtk1q.jpg)


As I may have mentioned, we weren’t the only ones on the mountain. By about 5:30am, the “Brightness Top” we’d rushed to so as to get a good shot of the sunrise was swarming. Pictured is just one of the maybe 10 clusters of 100+ people jostling to get a good perspective on the sunrise in this one particular viewing spot. Take note of the several cameras being held above heads by photographers desperate to get a shot of something, even if all they could see with their actual eyeballs was their neighbor's back.

Finally, the sun rose. And we missed it. Noah and I conferred and decided that a) the term “freezing to death” was gaining personal relevance for us, b) the sun was looking like it might be trapped behind clouds anyway, and c) we were taking spots that many sad-looking Chinese tourists would (maybe literally, we feared, legs dangling over our cliff edge) kill for. So we gave the clouds one last look, climbed down from our precipice, rubbed our frostbitten fingers together, and then heard a collective “Ooooooooh” go up from the thousand people around us. Apparently, as the tourists’ penchant for very audible appreciation of nature made clear, we missed the sunrise by about fifteen seconds. Out of necessity, I became Zen about this and snapped some post-sunrise pictures of the half-illuminated mountains. [Also, take note of the “waterfall” of clouds in the middle right of the photograph. It truly looked like a sea of clouds from above.]

They don’t call them the misty mountains for nothing. It was at moments like this one, as the sun dispelled the clouds and transformed them into a loose mist that obscured the bottoms of mountains, that I most felt like I was in the middle of some Avatar scene and started looking around for my blue dinosaur-bird to fly on.

Look at that beautiful Huangshan pine. Sadly, none of the photos I tried to take of these trees defying gravity and tree biology turned out well.

At some point, I had to hustle down the mountain to grab the bus back to Huangshan to grab the bus back to Tunxi to grab the bus back to Shanghai. When I tried to do so, I quickly discovered that hustling wasn’t an option. For the first and hopefully last time in my life, I spent an hour and a half in stop-and-go human traffic. I had to wait a minute between every step. After a while, fearful that I’d miss my bus, I joined the train of people trying to force their way along the right side of the pack. The hour of competitive, syrup-slow forward surging made me quite familiar with my chief 'fast-lane' companions, a few teenagers and a middle-aged woman. Right before we split up for good, I turned around and looked directly, for the first and last time, at the middle aged woman who had been trying to cut in front of me throughout our shared hour of pedestrian aggression. After a few seconds of staring, we both cracked up. It was one of my favorite moments on the mountain.

Before I went down, I had to go up. To exit, I took the “Ladder into the Clouds,” which was very literal. The hike took me up 1000+ steps on the side of and briefly into the mountain. When it hit the steps, the crowd thinned out (sort of), and I attempted to race ahead, resulting in a double leg cramp a quarter of the way up. Pictured is a short and relatively gentle leg of the ascent.

Going down from the top of the “Ladder” was one of the scariest experiences of my life. I am not particularly afraid of heights, but the extended descent, down steps carved into the vertical mountainside, was terrifying(ly beautiful). The only thing separating me from a thousand foot drop was a brittle-looking knee-high banister cut out of the same stone as the staircase. This descent spiraled down the side of the mountain and occasionally drilled through it. Pictured is the view, from the scary part of the descent, of a much more pleasant (and slightly less breathtaking) portion of the hike.

I saved this second example of Chinese tourist picture taking for last. Their photo-posing technique never cease to amaze.
