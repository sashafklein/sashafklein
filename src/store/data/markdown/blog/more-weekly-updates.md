Hey guys. I've been meaning to post more, (and to post more multimedia), but my internet access when not at work has gone way downhill, cause my computer is not cooperating. So, sorry Avery -- the food-production videos will have to wait for another week or two. In the meantime, enjoy (or skip) two more weeks of minutia of my day-to-day work:

**Week 6 (October 5-14)**

**Name: **Sasha Klein

**Center: **Shanghai Office

**General Overview of Activities: **It’s been a long, eventful “week.” I came back to the office last Wednesday. Other than that Friday, it’s been one ten-day stream of work. I returned early from October Break in Huangshan (amazing) to help Tara work with VIP students, mostly on their essays. A handful of these students, mostly from Shanghai, but also from Nanjing and Hangzhou, worked on their early applications in the office, where I helped them brainstorm and edit their essays, activity statements, resumes, supplements, why X college pieces, etc. My work with four of these students has been ongoing over the course of the week, so that I’ve probably seen a total of about 30-40 drafts (I’ve walked two students through 7 rewrites each of their PS), and I have about ten more on my plate for the day. This has taken up the bulk of my office time.

Tuesday, I also started what will be an ongoing assignment of working with/for a couple middle school students applying to US boarding schools. Sean, Sabrina, and I will be helping these students write their essays and prepare for interviews. (They actually fly. To the US. For interviews for High School.) On Tuesday, I was given a pile of essays from a student named Cheryl, who is clearly just exceptionally smart. As a 14 year-old, or whatever, Cheryl churned out four possible essays that were all astute, well-organized, and almost fluently written. If she doesn’t get into every boarding school she applies to, I’ll be shocked (and angry). I can’t wait to meet her in person next week (as a fake representative of some boarding school at which she’ll soon be interviewing).

Then on Tuesday, I shipped off to Fuyang again. At the end of my two day stay there, I left with some sense of what I’ll be working on: everything. It appears my duties will be a) to teach French, b) to run a psychology club, c) to teach graphic design, d) to teach essay writing, e) to help students fundraise for their expensive internationally recognized volunteer opportunities (Habitat, etc.), and f) to coach students through their attempts to get a “Duke of Edinburgh” award, which involves learning, athletics, and goal-setting. All of this is to be accomplished during the two half-days I’ll be spending in Fuyang each week. I’m super excited, but now I have to start cramming lesson-planning into my Shanghai office time (and probably some out-of-work hours).

**Favorite Interactions with Students: **This has been a week of great student interactions. In the office, I’ve worked one-on-one with everyone whose essays I’m helping edit. Jenny Wang is friendly, fluent, and all-together. Jenny Ni is extremely sweet and loves to bring in snacks for the whole team. Sarah is sharp, earnest, and open to suggestions. Sharon has a really admirable habit of arguing for anything she likes when I suggest editing it out. It’s just been a pleasure working with all of them.

And in Fuyang, I met up with two girls who wanted to start up the Psychology club, and they were just funny as hell. My interaction with them reminded me of the modeling photography scene in _Lost in Translation_: Every sentence to me was preceded by several sentences of excited Mandarin conferencing between the two of them. For thirty seconds, they’d jabber away, occasionally looking in my direction, and then they’d suddenly get quiet, turn serious, and rotate towards me: “We wanted to know. Can we play games in this club?” They also proposed a list of Psychology movies to watch that were mostly just horror flicks totally unrelated to Psychology. Each time they proposed something, they carefully removed a sheet with their handwritten proposal from an immaculate binder. Also, Mirabel, one of the girls, designated her friend Lily, the other, as the scribe, and every time I’d say something, Mirabel would poke Lily to remind her to write it down. Amusing.

**Areas of Concern: **I am now officially excited about everything I’m working on. No major concerns, other than how on earth I’m going to fit all this Fuyang stuff into my time there.

**On the Horizon/Plans:** A lot.

**Personal Updates/Funny China Moments/Great Things that Happened:&nbsp;** As you all probably don’t know, I’ve been trying to switch apartments for a while now. I was basically losing money (lots) on my current apartment, cause I couldn’t find a roomie willing to pay enough. So I searched for a new one and quickly found a great situation. But then I had to hand off my old apartment in order to get back my deposit and move.

The update is: Everything has worked out. I’ve found some people to buy my old apartment, so I’ll get my deposit back (and not be broke), and I’m moving into this great new apartment with friendly roommates in a perfect location shortly. Very excited. This had been stressing me out for weeks.

**Questions: **When do I figure out my vacation schedule???

**Files: **None

**Week 7 (October 17-21)**

**Name: **Sasha Klein

**Center: **Shanghai Office/Fuyang

**General Overview of Activities: **I always seem to write a lot for these things. Sorry. I guess this is how I get it all out:

In Shanghai, editing editing editing. I must have edited at least 20 documents or versions of documents on Monday and Tuesday.

In Fuyang, I refined the specifics of what my classes would entail, worked with senior threes on their essays (and conducted a quick ‘class’ on what to consider doing and avoiding in these essays). My involvement there has hit a major obstacle: the lack of time to work in. The counseling office had expected to be able to fit extracurricular scheduling into the students’ 2.5-hour lunch period, but the Chinese faculty has insisted that the students need this time to nap. Many students have complained about this and said repeatedly that they want an activities period instead, but the teachers (who, it seems, are arguing largely so they can have their own nap period), haven’t budged. And it looks like I’ll have very limited time to teach the three different things I was planning on teaching. Seriously frustrating.

**Favorite Interactions with Students: **My favorite student interaction this week was on paper. I was asked to look at a student’s essay, and it has to be my favorite essay ever. The student begins by talking about how he was just wasting time on the internet when he read an article about GPS locating and decided to track down his favorite celebrity. The rest of the essay is a detailed description of the rather ingenious methods he uses to eventually locate the apartment where “Mr. S” lives. He goes up to the door, looking to ask for a signature, and then, on the doorstep, decides he doesn’t care any more, because tracking the guy down was awesome enough. A fun example of his prose:

“As the satellite image showed, I first divided the large image into nine small ones: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I. I and H were the industrial regions, unless Mr. S would like to stay with polluting gas and water, he could not live there. According to the information collected from the blog, I could also eliminate A, C, E, F: the Walmart was in A; Cuiyuan Movie Theater was in C; there were only old and traditional style buildings in E and F. For G, which is where the West Lake is located, unless Mr. S was a fish, he would not be able to live there.”

Just an inch short of creepy. I loved it. While I’m cutting and pasting, I figure I might as well share another essay that began much less successfully with a pretty insanely philosophical but incomprehensible few sentences:

“If our souls are like born lines, everything for us is interested and fresh, at the same time, souls are tender and weak. Therefore what we are doing is practicing our souls and then make us powerful knowledge and creative. I used to have a tender soul but I did not know how to make it powerful until I grew up gradually and faced many experiences and matters. I still remembered that a the first day of a new term, I became an electrified assistant.”

**Areas of Concern: **How the heck I’m going to be able to cram three classes into the time slots I’ve got in Fuyang.

**On the Horizon/Plans:** Simultaneously starting up three classes in a week or two. Acting as a Loomis Chaffee representative to mock interview a student interested in applying to boarding schools in the US. Continuing to repress how much preparing for this interview makes me want to enter a time machine and go to Loomis Chaffee as a student.

**Grey zone moral issue of the week: **On Tuesday, I began what became a three-day saga of dealing with a student whose teacher recommendations – it became increasingly clear – were edited or written by the student herself. This became an ever-more-complicated moral conundrum for me, as I slowly came to confront the facts that a) apparently in most schools in China this is the common and only possible practice, and b) the student’s teachers had specifically requested that she write the recs, and planned out what they wanted her to write. I don’t really know what I should say to students in this case. It seems like they don’t have much of a choice.

**Personal Updates/Funny China Moments/Great Things that Happened:&nbsp;** I had an awesome Shanxi meal last night. Awesome. I strongly encourage anyone interested in trying it to come to Shanghai, so we can do some group Shanxi trips.

Also, I had a funny moment on the metro coming back from the train station. I sat next to an extremely gregarious middle aged woman. As I was reading a book (in English), she started talking to me in Chinese, to which I responded, “Duibuqi. Wo ting bu dong.” (Sorry, I don’t understand). To which she responded, “Ni ting bu dong?” At which I nodded. She was not deterred, and this exchange was followed by about twenty minutes of her blabbing really quickly at me in Mandarin and my politely trying to repeatedly inform her that I had no idea what was going on.

**Questions: **Is Karaoke with the WE team on Monday going to be really fun, or really intense?

**Files: **Nope. Sometime soon, though, I might try to upload to the wiki my semester plans for my Psychology, French, and Essay-Writing classes.
