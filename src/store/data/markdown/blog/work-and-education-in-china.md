Written a week ago:

I'm back in town after three days at a company-wide conference in Wuxi, a city 2.5-hours' bus or 25 minutes' fast-train ride from Shanghai. After two introductory days in Shanghai and these three days of corporate conferencing, I finally feel relatively knowledgeable about Dipont Education. It's a company with essentially two (actually, more, but…) different interrelated operations: a collection of Western, English-based "centers" attached to top public high-schools across the (mostly eastern half of the) country, and a western-college-counseling program, CACS, which is relatively new (two years) and, similar to and within the centers, is attached to but not entirely separate from existing Chinese high schools.

I am employed within the latter branch. It is quite unique within Chinese education. The Chinese educational system is extremely different from our own. Two main differences are central to my work here: the centrality of testing to the entire system, and the superiority of the public school system to the private. In China, everything is tested and ranked. There are colleges which are, definitively, the best colleges. Similarly, there are high schools which are simply the best high schools. Both are public, and admission to both is more or less entirely test-based. A top student gets into a top public middle school, and if she continues to test exceptionally, she gets into a top high school and, eventually, a top college. Grades, activities, and demonstrable uniqueness are essentially irrelevant to the process. It's all about testing.

Because of this clear ranking and tracking system, private schools exist essentially at the periphery of the main educational system, and are mostly there to provide options for the children of richer parents who did not test well enough to get into a sufficiently good middle school, high school, etc. Many of these students go to "international" schools and eventually funnel into good but not nearly so competitive schools abroad.

Meanwhile, the top Chinese colleges are so competitive that even many of the strong students in the best high schools in the country cannot get into the highest ranked colleges, so more and more of even the top public-school students are looking abroad for college. The problem is, the criteria for and processes of application are foreign to students here, who are used to simply cramming for the perfect Gao Kao score and being accepted.

In keeping with the widespread societal feeling that school applications are about test scores -- and that everything else is essentially peripheral or silly -- the other elements of the western college application process (personal essays, long-term recs, extracurriculars, etc.) are ignored or seen as wastes of extremely limited time. Consequently, it is an extremely common practice (read: 80% or up, apparently) among parents whose children are applying to American or British universities, to employ an "agent" to essentially take care of these elements of the applications for their clients. No kidding, apparently a huge majority of applications from China to the US are doctored by these agents, who often ask for tens of thousands of dollars US to massage/edit/more often write the essays, alter the transcripts, fabricate activities lists, etc., all the while claiming that because of alleged relationships with admissions deans, they can ensure parents their kids' entrance into any of the top-ranked American universities.

Add to that the rampant and fascinating use of ingenious but questionably educational test-prep methods (100% memorized essay answers for a variety of SAT prompts, stock expandable responses to verbal TOEFL testing, tricks such as automatically crossing out any answers in the SAT Critical Reading exam which include ", in which" or the word "befuddled", etc -- all based off of aggressive deconstruction of the tests and hours and hours of test-specific memorization and practice) and the culture's fixation on rankings as reflective of unequivocal actualities (as they are in China), and you end up with a serious college-application mess on your hands, in which huge numbers of "tiger moms" assume their children should get into Ivies—and pay fraudulent agents small fortunes to ensure they do so—with the result of fewer and fewer being accepted as more and more schools catch onto what's happening. Not to mention those being accepted often showing up with English skills significantly less functional than their tests imply and no preparation for the American school system.

Dipont markets itself as the antidote to this mess. In their centers, students intending to go to college in the US or UK go through usually three years of English-based education, in which they both improve their English and accustom themselves to the western model of education. Throughout all of this, Dipont's counseling program helps them develop their extracurricular interests, educates them (and their parents) about the American college application process, and through the process of helping students create their own essays, procure their own recs, and build their own interests, not only does a better job (so they claim) of getting these students into good colleges, but also prepares them for the colleges they will attend.

Because nowhere near the huge number of stunningly intelligent and well-educated students in China can get into the schools of their dreams (apparently, a 790 out of 800 on Math, Physics, or Chemistry SAT taken by a Chinese student is considered comparatively – and worryingly -- weak) a good part of the job of Dipont counselors is to attempt to gradually wear away at rankings-only-based thinking about American schools and introduce Chinese students and their parents to the wide array of strong educational institutions available to them in
the US. They recurrently emphasize "best fit".


Dipont's counseling services are primarily in-center and include a head counselor or two -- usually someone who has worked for some time in counseling or admissions -- paired with a few Chinese counselors affiliated with the team. There are also "VIP" counselors, who are not affiliated with any particular school, and who, for additional cost, can be hired to provide apparently added expertise for students applying to college. The western team is actually relatively small, comprised of maybe 15 westerners scattered among a number of centers, each responsible for maybe on average about 150 senior-year applicants, in addition to the sophomores and juniors entering the process.

> The Dipont Center map, where my new peeps at.

The role of us "Dipont Fellows" (the title was recently changed from "Academic Ambassadors") is a little more nebulous. We are essentially flexible, fresh-faced, recently-college-stamped assistants in the counseling process. There is one Fellow per school center, and his responsibilities are open but essentially entail assisting in the process in whatever way possible: helping start and nurture activities for students, creating reading or writing clubs, helping work on essays and recs, answering student questions, and being living advertisements to the program's affiliation with top universities.

As one of the three Shanghai-office based fellows, my job description is even more nebulous. At the conference, where center teams were repeatedly brought together to outline plans and train on counseling staples, we were sort of hanging off the edge of things. There is a school in Shanghai, but we weren't specifically hired for it, and in keeping with China's very real apparent inability to figure anything out more than a minute in advance, it's unclear whether or not the
CACS counseling program will be invited by the school to be part of the center at all -- not to mention whether they'll have students or whether any of those students will be applying to college this year.

So we may be working part-time with them doing reading clubs, etc for sophomores. Or we may not.

In addition, we talked a fair amount about other things we might be employed to do: work on a database of materials for counselors; work on inventive marketing to combat a couple possible competitors. I chatted with the head of CACS (for a while) today, and he seems to have plans for us to do a large amount of VIP-counseling assistance as well. It's all still up in the air at the very least until we show up to work on Monday, when the bosses who have been running around the conference for the last few days or dealing with the whole extended CACS group finally sit down and figure out what they want us to do.

I have faith that it will coalesce into something, and, I hope, that the options I'll have to chose from will leave me with mostly interesting and educational things to do.

Also, randomly, because we're now "fellows," one of our responsibilities is to work, over the course of the year, on an "Independent Research Project" ideally touching on education in China, or just China, or something. I don't know. It's probably going to end up being a paper of reasonable size. I'm supposed to propose an idea by the 21st of September. And I have absolutely no idea what I'd be interested in researching, or how I'd go about it. I suppose once I begin to work (maybe with students), ideas are more likely to arise, but if any of my loyal readers have a lightbulb moment about what it might be interesting to write, do let me know.

Although the job's a little frustratingly unclear at the moment, I'd have trouble feeling more positively about the organization on a personnel front. The fellow fellows (there are maybe 15 of them) are a really nice, smart, interesting, diverse group. We spent five days getting all chummy together, but we just dispersed post-conference. They're all over mostly eastern China. We're apparently asked to keep one another updated about what's going on (for both social and professional reasons) by weekly emails, and there will be some Shanghai re-gathering in November. And hopefully I'll have some time to go visit some of them (they're a great excuse to go all over), and visa versa. But it was a little sad to form this pretty close community and then scatter after just five days.

There are, however, the other two Shanghai fellows, in addition to two very nice "VIPs", a whole bunch of very cool and sweet and smart Chinese aspiring counselors, the friendly recent college grad in charge of the fellow program, a cool and more established HR department, and a seriously nice and competent bunch of bosses. It's really a good group. And young (avg age has got to be 25 or something, bosses excluded).

As well as incredibly new. It's downright ridiculous. Because of how young the branch is and how quickly it's growing, the whole organization is fresh. The head of the whole branch has been here for about half a year. Same with his immediate underlings. I think the person who hired me might be the person who's been here the longest, and she transferred from Disney China two years ago. Which certainly contributes to the pervasive air of nobody-other-than-(or-including?)-leadership-really-knows-what's-going-on. This may also, as I have been informed, just be the way things work in China.

On the non-work front, I go apartment and phone searching tomorrow. I passed up the opportunity to live with the other fellows, in favor of getting a double apartment and searching for a non-Dipont roommate on my own. I figure it will be more conducive to living my own life. And with all the friends at work (really, there are tons of nice and social Americans and Chinese), and with all the contacts I've been put in touch with, the chances seem pretty slim that I'll have anything other than a very social experience here, whether or not I live with people.

Shanghai is really cool. It seems likely that, given the unobtrusive but pervasive smog, I'll get three or four days of sunlight this year. But whatever. The city is both extremely comfortably western (there are, I have heard, 143 Starbucks stores citywide) and refreshingly foreign. Traffic's a mess. The Bund is beautiful. The area where I will live and work is fun. And there are tons of upscale and grittier everythings.

When I settle in, I plan to find a tutor and a gym, locate my local hipster coffee shop, and find my groove. No real culture shock or freakout yet. As soon as I feel settled, I also plan on getting a list of good Chinese philosophy texts from a very impressively fluent coworker, memorizing a couple hundred characters and then obsessively reading texts in the original. In a few weeks, of course, I should be fluent.
