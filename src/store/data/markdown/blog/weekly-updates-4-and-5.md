So as to put some space between my Huangshan post and the next one I plan on putting up, I'm going to go ahead and give you guys a spacer post consisting of the past two weekly updates I've turned in. You are now officially up to date on my office life, so I'll be updating this on a week-by-week basis from now on.

Also, if you missed it in my last post, I've now uploaded 140 Huangshan photos on Picasa. Check them out here: http://goo.gl/J5Xw8 .

**Week 4 (Sept 19-23)**

**Name: **Sasha Klein

**Center: **Shanghai Office

**General Overview of Activities: **Hmm. This week was pretty all over the place. Post-Skype-chat, I spent a good deal of time working on editing WE magazine, which remains a pretty rocky publication. As Sean alluded to, a lot of the Chinese-written articles are extremely confusing in terms of not only language and formatting but also content and ideas. A fun example is an article on leadership I edited that was chock full of uncomfortably intense assertions like: “Wanderers are miserable because their burdened lives repeat again and again. Only with the clear direction we can have breakthrough and finally taste the joy of victory.” Sean and I had fun with that one.

I also put some work into a presentation for Christian on California trivia, and rediscovered my lifelong love of PowerPoint. So much fun. Also, California’s a really cool place. Did you know that, counted as a country, California would be the 7th largest economy in the world? And that it has both the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United States?

Also, it looks like I’ll be part-timing in Fuyang with Dan. Head over to check things out next week. I’m looking forward to getting some more student interactions, and to becoming familiar with the Fuyizzle, after all the things I’ve heard about it.

Additionally, on the student interaction front, it looks like Sean, Sabrina, and I will get to work with middle school students looking to go to boarding high schools in the states. For maybe two hours a week, we get to sit down with these young scholars and help them through their essays and the such. Exciting.

**Favorite Interactions with Students: **On Tuesday (I think), I got to Skype chat with a student to help her through her essay brainstorming process. I’d read her first essay before meeting her, and I was worried both that she’d have trouble figuring out how to write a good essay and that she’d be difficult to deal with. (Her essay painted a pretty worrying picture, so it needed some major rewrites.)

When I actually sat down to talk to her, she was lovely. She seemed enthusiastic and thoughtful, and she spoke English well (better, I thought, than her essay had suggested). She was quick to pick up on distinctions I was making about what colleges are looking for, and she jumped into brainstorming really well. I think we came up with some really good essay ideas, and I’m excited to see how her main idea turns out. It could turn into a really great essay if she does it right. At any rate, I was surprised by the encounter, and really enjoyed working with her. It got me excited for future Fuyang/Middle School interactions.

**Areas of Concern: **WE. Sean and I have been working pretty steadily on editing it, and it has a long, long way to go before it looks and sounds professional. It’s been pretty tough moving forward with the magazine’s main editor, who tends to ignore a solid 50% of our comments. Luckily, however, what we thought was a major plagiarism issue (an entirely scanned article from another magazine) turns out to have been a licensed reprint. Phew. (If still a little bit weird.)

**On the Horizon/Plans:** Fuyizzle! Middle school counseling!

**Personal Updates/Funny China Moments/Great Things that Happened:** I had two really awesome Shanghainese meals this week. Yum.

Also, as has been mentioned, our trivia team got second place last night, securing 300 kuai of bar vouchers to be cashed in on the next time we show up to dominate. Once again, if anyone is interested in coming into Shanghai to participate in our trivia victory machine, let us know. Thursdays, 9:30pm. 1 Wulumuqi North Rd. Be there.

**Questions: **None. **Answers:** I loved the conference. Let’s make it daily.

**Files: **None

**Week 5 (Sept 26-30)**

**Name:**Sasha Klein

**Center:**Shanghai Office

**General Overview of Activities: **This week was split. I spent the first three days in the Shanghai Office, where I primarily went through a second set of WE edits, threw together a couple pee-pee-tees on medical school, law school, and business school applications, worked on two blog posts, and prepped for my trip to Fuyang.

On Thursday, I shipped off to the Fushizzle (apparently, I've been mistyping the town's G-ification), where Dan introduced me to the team. I’ll be working here, likely two days a week, doing all sorts of extracurricular things. Dan is focused on innovation, so he steered me away from a more general reading club and towards things like helping kids fund-raise for their Habitat etc clubs, teaching French (sounds kind of ambitious), starting a Psychology club, maybe doing a graphic design club, etc. I will be doing all this under the leadership of Dan’s GF Joyce, who is very nice.

I arrived early afternoon, and after a tour and a couple meetings with a whole bunch of teachers/authority figures (one of whom wanted very badly to drink some Johnnie Walker with me at 3pm), I was asked to put together a 25ish minute presentation introducing myself and explaining why I’m here. Which I then gave to the 100-odd students I may be working with. I think this will all be really fun – though a little all over the place.

**Favorite Interactions with Students:**_Funniest/most defensive interaction_: After my presentation, there was Q and A, and then, after everyone dispersed, a line of students who wanted to ask questions in person. Every one of them asked for my email address (yay @cacs.org.cn) until Blair, who decided to up the arms race. With an unbelievably quiet voice and a disdainful flick of the head, Blair said she didn’t “care for email." … ... … “What’s your QQ?” As my QQ is an extremely important e-sanctuary for me, I had a brief internal freak out, which I think I successfully hid. I said, I hope believably, that I don’t have one yet. Phew.

Additionally funny. My presentation included the Dipont map displaying China with yellow dots for where the centers are. After my presentation, a student came up to inform me that my map was incorrect, because it didn’t include Taiwan. I apologized, and he graciously accepted.

_Favorite interaction_: After Blair, a girl practically sprinted up with her two friends and, in a voice at least equal to the combined volumes of the five voices which had preceded hers, introduced herself as, “Hee! Bee! H!-E!-E!-B!-E!-E!” I’d talked in my presentation about considering majoring in Psychology, and Hee Bee wanted to start up a psychology club, but was worried about her and her friends’ comprehension levels. I think this would be really fun, so I’m hoping we can work out a way to make scholarly articles digestible, maybe going through pop psych, or sticking mostly to article abstracts, etc.

**Areas of Concern:** There were moments in my presentation when I said something slowly and I hope clearly, and the kids didn’t respond to it until the picture slide accompanying it was shown. So I’m worried they were about 70% following the PowerPoint, and that most of them had trouble following what I was saying. I tried to be really clear, but I think gauging and dealing with varying language levels will be a concern in the future.
