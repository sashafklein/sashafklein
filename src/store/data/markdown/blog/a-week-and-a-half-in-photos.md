Rather than pontificate some more, I figured it might be fun to show you guys some highlights from the last week or so:

Fall’s coming, and even the hair is changing colors. The temp dropped 15F overnight and seems to be staying there. Yesterday morning, the change in temperature seemed to mean promising things for the city’s smell. On my walk from the metro to work, the usual sulfur smell was mysteriously replaced by some weird but not unappealing cross between smoked fish and waffles. Unfortunately, all further olfactory evidence has pointed to this being a fluke.

I went to a music festival Sunday night. It was fun. Ludacris said, “Whatup LA.” And some guy named Grandmaster Flex sampled Gangstarr’s “Full Clip” and won my complete approval. The festival was by the Shanghai Rugby stadium, so people got to chill on bleachers listening to Whine Rock (or chill by bleachers right in front of my camera, looking perceptive), while off on another stage Luda went off about hos and his many number one hits.

Beats the hell out of KFC. (Incidentally, KFC here also beats the hell out of KFC.) At a Chinese quick-fried chicken place, my chicken was pounded, breaded, and double deep-fried to order, then dusted in a fragrant mixture of what I think was star anise, cinnamon, szechuan peppercorn, and salt. As the pre-photo teethmarks indicate, it smelled good enough that I couldn't wait.

A friend recently pointed me to this interesting study on Chinese and American memory recall. Its findings throw some light on the slippery definition of "unique" in this country.

A restaurant near where I live serves up some amazing soups from Qian. Pictured below is a vinegar-chili broth with pickled vegetables and egg noodles (left) and cold buckwheat noodles with chili, cucumber, bean sprouts, and chili oil. Not pictured is the huge smoked lamb stew with chewy soaked bread pieces. I've now added another destination to my future travels list. And -- added plus -- Qian's got the Terra Cotta warriors.

The important-sounding French Concession. A walk down these plain-tree-lined streets can trick you into thinking you're in a quaint Provencal village. Until a hawker screams, "Hello! Watch!" at you.

Some closeups of Uighur food, from the northwest. This delicious cuisine relies heavily on cumin and lamb, and has very noticeable (and very delicious) Moroccan and Middle-Eastern influences. Below, you have a way-too-close-up of lamb ribs, very fatty, fried after being marinated with lots of cumin. Then a Uighur interpretation of the Szechuan classic dry-fried green beans. And finally a pretty delicious beef stew with pickled chilies and "sour spinach" (tastes sort of like sorrel). Mmm.

I guess the thought was, why not park this building in the middle of central Shanghai?

DC-metropolitan-area all the way, but a pot of old-bayed Maryland crabs doesn't stand much of a chance against this vat of tasty crustaceans buried in chili oil, onion, coriander, Chinese celery, and spice, with big chewy clumps of gnocchi-like rice dumplings. You can cool your mouth off with the vinegar-marinated edamame, cucumber-and-sea-jelly salad, and one of the only bottles of ice cold water I've found in a restaurant here.
