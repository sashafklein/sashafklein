I had a minor “critical incident” the other day at the local Tesco.

While I was in the produce section, waiting near the front of a short line to weigh my long beans, a man swerved in from my periphery, jumping in front of my line-mate and I to plop his garlic onto the scale. Crippled by my inability to effectively aggress in Chinese, I just stood there, internally huffing at this offender and waiting for him and his intruding bag of garlic to get out of the way.

> I've been working on my Dry-Fried Green Beans, pictured upper right. Thus the Tesco face off. Unfortunately, early attempts suggest that I'll never make them quite as well as these ones, purchased, along with cumin-scented braised then fried (I think) ribs and what I think was winter melon and chives, at a favorite restaurant near my apartment -- for about 8 bucks total. When I whip out my fancy camera in a day or two, the food will start looking as delicious as it is.

He left. Shortly followed by another man, who cut the line with similar nonchalance, dropping his eggplant onto the scale as if he didn’t even notice me standing there, figurative steam pouring out of my ears. There I was, a foot away from the scale, waiting for the one-second window of time I needed to calmly place my produce on the scale, and constantly thwarted by shoppers swooping rapidly in from all angles. Eventually, I pounced the second after one shopper finished, throwing my beans on the scale, getting a weight sticker, and stomping off, annoyed but satisfied.

Only to realize seconds later, of course, that there was no line to begin with. And it’s beginning to dawn on me that the lack of a line at the Tesco produce scale, the aggressive car-over-pedestrian driving tactics, and the Shanghai population’s complete indifference to being jostled in ways that would start a brawl back in the States – all these things are symptoms of the most inescapable fact about life in Shanghai, and in China in general:

There are a ton of people.

Ton doesn’t even come close. There are simply too many people to wrap your head around. Certainly too many people to wait in line behind, to watch slowly stroll across the path your car needs to take, or to collect apologies from when the crush of rush-hour traffickers bumps them into you. &nbsp;

Shanghai is packed with apartment buildings. According to Wikipedia, while New York City scatters its 18 million metropolitan residents over roughly 7000 square miles, Shanghai crams its 23 million into about a third of that space, meaning roughly four times as many people – just under 10,000 – live in a Shanghai square mile as in a New York City one. When its citizens funnel into their tall apartment buildings at night, the streets empty out, and parts of Shanghai can feel oddly dead. When Shanghai wakes up during the day, however, (or during night at the right/wrong places), the thousands of apartment buildings open their doors and flood the city with people.

> Shanghai rush hour on a (moving) metro car. Every time I take one of these photos, it completely fails to capture how packed it is. Oh well. Take my word for it. You can barely budge.

Shanghai rush hour has a dystopian cinematic quality to it. I can’t shake, as I’m herded up and down the metro escalators, a bone-deep feeling of personal minuteness and irrelevance. Just on this one metro car, heading in this one direction, I’m one of thousands. In front of me and behind me there are others, and others, all filled to the brim with people being carted off to work. And then they all pour out onto the street, where the crowds seem not to thin out above ground, but to thicken and gather.

Turning around in the middle of the march to work is like pressing against a school of fish. Stopping short or deviating slightly from one’s prescribed path and velocity means colliding with a wall of bodies moving with a combined momentum. As one body, this fluid human organism collects in the subway and then, in starts and stops like a Brownian fluid, courses along the streets until dispersing back into the high-rise office buildings. The whole experience feels very much like Brasil.

> Another crappy phone photo. Rush-hour traffic is such an irresistible force that I’m unable to stop to snap the photo. Thus the camera shake.

After living here for only two weeks, I have begun to feel very clearly how the overwhelming size of the population here can effect not just how one goes to and from work, but how one thinks about one’s place in society, and how one interacts with the world at large.

In a country this populous, with so very many people who want all the same things that you do, organized deferral is hugely inefficient. The Tesco by my apartment has over 30 checkout lanes, and during every visit I have made to the establishment, they are all open and each servicing lines of 5 people or (far more often) more. The produce section, site of my bout of western indignation, is a whirlwind of activity, so packed that people routinely shove your cart out of their way or bump into you without so much as a grunt.

A week ago, as a fresher-faced foreigner, I accidentally shoulder bumped an older man getting on the metro car. When I turned to him and said my attempt at “duibuqi” – more or less “excuse me” – he looked at me with incredulity and cracked a huge smile. Having moved around the city for a week since, it seems legitimately likely to me that he was so happy because I was the first person to ever apologize to him for something so minor. I’ve certainly yet to hear a duibuqi for any of the daily body checks I receive.

It’s just that there’s too much going on – too many opportunities for looking back and apologizing here in China – to risk starting the practice of looking back at all. It’s too much time, too much emotional engagement. It’s better just to keep looking ahead.

The same goes for things we would consider unequivocally worth apologizing for in the west. That man who cut me off at the Tesco would draw angry outbursts from the Tina Feys of New York City, but he was busy getting his food and getting back home. If he had to slow his rush and defer to overcrowded lines every time he went anywhere, he’d never accomplish anything.

So he edges ahead. He cuts you off. He pushes comfortably into what we (overreacting) might consider the morally gray, in order to win a little bit more for himself. It’s pushy; it’s rude; it’s arguably unfair. It’s also a hundred percent necessary.
