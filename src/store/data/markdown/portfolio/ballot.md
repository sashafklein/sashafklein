I was heavily involved in Bernie Sanders's primary campaign during the 2016 US elections. As the primary and the election progressed, I became increasingly invested in and concerned about the security, auditability, and transparency of our electoral process.

After looking for non-partisan ways to invest in a more democratic electoral future, I found the [Open Source Elections Technology Institute](http://www.osetfoundation.org/) (OSET). OSET is working to build a full suite of quality open-source elections tools which will be afforable and transparent alternatives to the closed, outdated, and non-auditable technologies the sold by current elections-tech vendors.

Volunteering for OSET, I built out a fully-functional, accessible, cross-state and cross-platform ballot-marking application designed to slot into OSET's ecosystem of elections tools. The app -- built in React Native for both Android and iOS phones -- takes variably defined elections specs (rank-choice, etc), and turns them into a custom, and customizable, voting flows resulting in data blobs to be handed onto the next link in the OSET technology chain.
