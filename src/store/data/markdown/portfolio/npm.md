[AVA Describe](https://github.com/sashafklein/ava-describe) is an NPM package for nesting tests in AVA (a very lightweight testing runner/matching library) into more human-readable `describe` and `context` blocks, like those common with other JavaScript testing tools.

[Shape](https://github.com/sashafklein/shape) (technically, `matches-shape`) is an NPM package for asserting and testing object shape in JavaScript. It provides a simple syntax for declaring what an object structure should be, and for testing that declared shape against the received object, and storing any failures for easy access. Particularly useful for testing the output of inconsistent APIs.
