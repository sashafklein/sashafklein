I had another anti-culture-shock two nights ago. A couple American coworkers and I headed out to meet a Chinese colleague at a place called Barbarossa. It was a beautiful, hip, thoroughly modern and international bar, sitting, as well as I could locate it at night, in the middle of a watery oasis-garden near People’s Square. The classy Moroccan restaurant on the first floor gave way to a glossy and packed bar with a DJ and a patio on the second, and a gorgeous, open rooftop on the third, where we may or may not have crashed a private party before heading onto the next hole.

Which was on the Bund, the strip of French-looking once-administrative buildings on the western waterfront of the Huangpu River, overlooking the modern business sector called Pudong. When we arrived at Bar Rouge, at 18 on the Bund, ten minutes before the free entrance gave way to a $15 cover, they were “at capacity,” a state of affairs that immediately ended when the clock struck midnight and they started admitting everybody with the 100-kuai fee in hand. We moved on.

To a huge and glittery seventh-floor bar with an extensive and expensive mixed-drink menu (roughly $12 a drink), where we finally settled down for a relatively cheap pitcher of sangria, and I began to look around and process what had been an unexpected night.

I have traveled pretty extensively, to South America, Asia, North Africa, The Middle East, and Europe, and never, perhaps outside of New York, have I felt that I was so thoroughly part of a western, first-world bar and club scene. Without question, Chinese people accounted for at most half the percentage of the going-out population Friday night that they did on Harvard’s campus. Almost everyone I saw was white. Add to that the fact that although the Bar Rouge party was themed (Flower Power!), I didn’t see a single person dressed on theme. It felt just like college.

Brooklyn hipsters and sleeked-hair-and-corduroyed Georgetown (read Final-Club-, Harvard folk) preps abounded, interspersed here and there with a handful of more expectedly Expat-looking westerners – older, less fashion-conscious, friendlier-looking. Out of maybe 150 people in the seventh-floor bar we went to, I spotted perhaps 10-15 locals. Who may or may not have actually been locals. It was weird.

And it all makes me wonder what I want out of my experience here. Cause I looked around at that instinctively familiar crowd of 150 foreigners, and I felt comfortable. I mean, this is my group. That reasonable PPH of prepsters made me feel right at home. And glancing around the large, posh room, I found myself wondering what everyone’s story was, and, moreover, wanting to go ask them, join them, slip into a community that I know I could easily and comfortably make my own.

A week ago, at the Wuxi conference, I was told that a school in suburban Ningbo – a small (relative) town with just a handful of white people and, I have since heard, a major cockroach problem – was looking for a Fellow, and I was asked whether I would be interested in making the switch. My formerly voiced interest in a “real China experience” was referenced, and I found myself standing there trying to answer the question immediately at hand while struggling to address my internal concerns about what I actually want out of my time in China.

Obviously, despite said formerly voiced interest, I had chosen Shanghai over other, more “real” experiences. But now that I’m here, (quite happily) settled into my modern apartment building and taking the world’s most extensive subway line to work in a 43rd-floor office, I find myself second-guessing that inclination.

What do I want out of my time here? Mandarin competence, valuable work experience, an enjoyable year or two, for sure. But also, I think I want a cultural ice bath, an experience that stretches me to the point of discomfort – which is, as I have recently been reminded, the feeling of growth. And while Shanghai offers me what seems to be a truly interesting work experience and the prospect of a fun year, it may translate to a year that skimps on the rest of my criteria.

My worry is that my desire to turn my time in Shanghai into a combination of a great and expansive work and personal journey may either be impossible or require a serious amount of persistent effort. Because it seems like any “real China experience” to be found in this city involves a good deal of digging.
