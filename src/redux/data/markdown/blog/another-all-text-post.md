It just occurred to me that those of my readers interested in the content of my work here (all one of you, Niko) might get a kick out of seeing my weekly reports. Every week, us DFs email out to one another updates on what and how we’re doing at work, to keep each other in the loop. Additionally, every two weeks, I turn in a formal report to my bosses that is far drier and less interesting, and so will not find its way onto these virtual pages.

I figured you guys might be interested in seeing what I have – or just as often have not – been up to. As I’m about to start possibly working at three different schools (!), these could soon get more interesting.

One last thing, since there’s a backlog, I’m going to upload weeks 1-3, and then give it a few days (while I’m off hiking around the misty gorgeousness of Huangshan, SLR finally in hand) before updating the other two. After that, I think I’ll just throw up my latest every week.

Enjoy:

**WEEK 1 (Aug 29- Sept 2)**

**General Overview of Activities:** Lots. I've been spending most of my
 time trying to create an American Culture curriculum, plan out
 articles for the aforementioned WE [Dear Readers: a very poorly named student-aimed internal publication], fix the wiki database of materials
 for you guys to use, and make long-term plans about blogs, podcasts,
 Alumni networks, and more. Hopefully in the next week or so, we should
 figure out what's happening re the two schools Katie mentioned. And
 eventually all this disparate stuff might settle into some sort of
 routine.

**Favorite Interactions with Students:** &nbsp;Haven't met one yet :( .

** Areas of Concern:** &nbsp;None, really. Things are going well. There are lots
 of interesting projects on the horizon. I'm actually looking forward
 to pretty much everything I have to do in the near future.

** On the Horizon/Plans:** &nbsp;Making some progress on the Culture Course,
 Alumni Database, Blog redesign, and podcast, and figuring out what's
 going to happen with these schools.

** Personal Updates/Funny China Moments/Great Things that Happened:** &nbsp;I am
 like 90% set up and moved in! Took a while and a very stressful IKEA
 run. Excited to start practicing my Szechuan cooking. Also, it is
 downright weird how few Chinese people we saw at the bars/clubs we
 went to Friday. Somehow we ended up in expat village, and I felt like
 I was in NYC.

**WEEK 2 (Sept 5-9)**

**General Overview of Activities:&nbsp;**We spent the first couple days putting together a 3-year-plan proposal that Dipont can use to sell CACS services to high schools. Basically outlining what all the members do in month-by-month detail, and how that adds up to a complete mission. We listed all sorts of projects the Fellows do that they may or may not actually do. Fun.&nbsp; Hopefully it'll be a good sell.

Incidentally, it's downright shocking how much support CACS gives these kids. I remember my (lovely) college counselor pretty much just vetoing my first essay draft, OKing the second, and wishing me luck.

**Favorite Interactions with Students: **:( again.

**On the Horizon/Plans:** Partying this weekend! And starting up Chinese lessons maybe next week. Also, I just tried cooking my first Szechuan meal for myself last night. It was way too much food, and a little underwhelming, but I see future successes on the horizon. Becoming a good Chinese chef is a major step for me in my quest to eventually pass for a Chinese person.

**Personal Updates/Funny China Moments/Great Things that Happened: **I had a pretty fun Shanghai rush-hour experience this morning. I was the last person to fit into the metro car when the doors opened. Just managed to squeeze in and then rotate. There was clearly no room for anyone else. So, one by one, like 10 more people pressed in. By the end of it, I think I could have lifted my feet off the ground and remained suspended by the ten bodies pressed into me. There are a lot of people here.

**Questions: **Can't wait to have you all over to Shanghai this weekend! See you soon.

**WEEK 3 (Sept 12-16)**

**General Overview of Activities:** Early in the week, the three of us finished cataloging the documents on the DF Wiki, and Wednesday and Thursday, we reorganized all the documents by content (instead of center). Hopefully, it should be helpful to you guys in planning lessons and working with students. It remains, however, a pretty ugly website. There didn’t seem to be much we could do about that within the constraints of the Wiki format. Also, we’ve still got last year’s AAs up there in the picture slideshow, but they seem like a nice bunch, and they take some nice pictures, so I think it’s fine for now.

Thursday and Friday, I helped Christian put together some content for his Cali presentations. Additionally, I read up on the Common App and Personal Statement writing so that I can be more informed when I do more counseling.

Today, I get to help a student work on her essay. Which unfortunately seems to mean scrapping her essay and starting from scratch.

**Favorite Student Interactions:** The above is the only.

**Areas of Concern:** Katie and Sabrina left for Ningbo this Thursday and Friday, leaving Sean and I to fend for ourselves. Being my own boss was a new and uncomfortable experience, particularly because we just wrapped up some projects, and I wasn’t left with too much of our planned work to do. Also, I haven't felt licensed to use our conference room without them, and I'm beginning to miss that place every time I pass it.

**On the Horizon/Plans:** Depending on Yang Fei’s impending possible approval, we may start working in earnest on some of our bigger projects (American Culture Course, Alumni Database) soon.

**Personal Updates/ Funny China Moments/Great Things that Happened:** Katie’s roommate Caroline and I did trivia at a bar in the French Concession last night, and we weren’t half bad. Although we didn’t win, we came in well above average, and as two people playing mostly against teams of 5-8, we definitely had the highest per capita scores. If any of you is looking to join our dream team and come into Shanghai weekly for trivia nights, get in touch. FYI for team strategery, our weaknesses are history and sports, as well, apparently, as recognizing short clips of British Invasion songs. We rock at Germany-specific questions.

OK. Fine. I'll upload some photos. Gaze upon the Mecca that is "Yang's Fried-Dumpling."

For 6 kuai (a bit under a buck), you can get four of the things (couldn't wait to eat, so I took one out before snapping the photo). They start solid, then end up half soup, because the filling put into the dumplings contains large amounts of collagen and some fat, both of which melt into soup when they're double fried and sprinkled with sesame and chives. Sorry for the blurry photo.

For 12 kuai, you can get the below delicious awesomeness of a soup: a hot, vinegary pork broth with fatty pork bits, lots of cilantro, roasted peanuts, and glassy sweet-potato noodles.
