Hey everyone. It’s been a while. My home  internet and failing computer aren’t mixing well, and I’ve only been  able to get on the web at work, which is, for obvious reasons, not the  best place to spend an hour uploading pictures to a personal blog.

So now that I’m temporarily back online,  I’m going to try to take out a couple posts at once. Firstly, to satisfy  Avery, I’m going to upload a series of videos showing food production  in China. (Because Tumblr is a terrible blog platform, and video-posting  on it takes ridiculous amounts of time and still turns out poorly, I've  just posted links to the videos, which I uploaded to youtube.) Then I’m  going to post some photos – of food, and of a trip to Suzhou, “The  Venice of the East.” Then I’m going to post a surprise.

Unfortunately, this is way too much to  upload quickly using my internet connection, so these videos and images  might trickle out over the course of a few days. But since I have to  start somewhere, without further ado:

> Taiwanese food is, as far as I can  tell, a more discreet, less Tom-Sawyer-friendly version of Chinese food,  with a good deal of deep-fried everything. Pictured are three dishes –  deep fried glutinous rice cakes, baby greens with pork sauce, and a  rice-wine-marinated deep-fried pork chop – from a restaurant near the  office.

> A day in Fuyang. The ten veggie  dumplings below cost 4 kuai, or about 70 cents, making for a very  reasonable breakfast. For lunch, I get to watch the [magic of pull noodles in preparation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7icnleJhc)  before devouring them, at the local Muslim noodle soup shop. Then,  dinner. The tripe-and-noodle soup with mild chives down the street is  delicious, though whenever we go there instead of Fuyang’s godsend of an  all-you-can-eat-and-drink hotpot place, I feel like I missed out.

_The below are the components of a  phenomenal Cantonese meal our visiting family friend Larry Ng took me to  the other week. Absolutely delicious. In order: Thin wheat noodles in a  spicy peanut sauce with a refreshing spike of citrus. Shrimp and pork  wontons in fragrant chili oil. Soothing (and blurry) vermicelli in a  mushroom sauce. Delicate deep-fried shrimp dumplings. Fried turnip cakes  with scallions and XO sauce. Congee with croutons, scallions, and  mushrooms._

> These condiments accompany northern  hotpot (video preparation below). Chili oil, chopped fresh coriander,  and fresh, homemade sesame paste (ground out front) with a splash of  some sweet soy-based sauce.

[Butchering lambs for tomorrow's hotpot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGSawqBuKIo).

> [This guy must slice at least five lambs' worth of meat every day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDDVKW6l_Bg). You buy it by the plate of razor-thin  slices, which are submerged in the boiling broth and then dipped, along  with a variety of veggies and other edibles, in the sauces above.

[Hot Pot a-boiling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVGQMPLcHms). In northern hotpot  like this (I think it's northern), the ingredients are cooked in spiced  water rather than a mild or fiery Szechuan-style broth._

> Xibei (Northwest) food. This stuff is  to die for.

This restaurant is known for its variety of oat noodles and its roast meats (which we forgot to order – this time). I went there  with three eating assistants and wiped out the below:

> Cold tripe with  chili oil, scallion, and almonds.

> Homemade yogurt (to which one adds  wildflower honey).

> Roast eggplant mashed with chilies and raw garlic.

> House-made fresh tofu (earthy and heavy in texture – mmm) with chili-soy  sauce.

> Wilted greens with chili and garlic.

> A blurry photo of what I called “honeycomb” noodles. These are oat noodles made individually by twisting the dough around a  cylindrical wooden tool and then placing all the individual noodles  together to grow together and be cooked in these wooden steamers. They  bring the noodles to the table and then break them apart for you to dip into either a lamb or mushroom broth (below).

> The surprise! Here’s Jakub! Clearly  thoroughly enjoying our hotpot. Kuba and his sister Weronika are  spending a month in China. They’ll be staying in Shanghai and area for  about a week before heading west.

> The three of us went to Suzhou to see  the famed gardens and canals. Very pretty place, with some very yummy,  mild food, pictured a little bit below.

> Suzhou inspired our attempts at contemplation of beauty, becoming Zen, and weird kung-fu playacting.

> Our Suzhou dinner. Suzhou food is generally mild and fish-based.  We had a local catfish-and-pickled-cabbage stew, some frogs legs cooked  with clams and rice wine, and sweet-and-sour pork done right (actually  sour, not that sweet).

Suzhou's cinematic nightime lighting  inspired some striking but painfully low-res phone photographs. Not sure  what the photo op here was, but I liked it.
