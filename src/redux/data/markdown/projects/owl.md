A dead simple app built in a day, Quote Owl was a simple response to my desire to be regularly, simply reminded of the quotations I found meaningful.

Rather than buying into a preexisting quote list, or dealing with a clunky interface, users can build a list of their own, through a simple email interface. Every day, a quote is sent out by email, and that same address can be responded to to add any new quotes.

A simple point tracker ensures that you don't see the same quote too frequently, and a basic subscription system allows multiple people (ex: me, my brother, and my uncle) to subscribe and add to the same list of quotes.

Lightweight and straightforward, this one-day Rails app has added a lot of happiness to my life.
