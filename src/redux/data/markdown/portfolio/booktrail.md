BookTrail has nothing fancy going on. It's a vanilla Rails app I put together one day to create a place where people could keep track of their reading.

The interface allows you to "start" a book and then update ratings, notes, description, and finishing time, allowing you to track your reading experiences and opinions over the years.

Unlike Goodreads, its main correlate, BookTrail is automatically private; nobody can see your "book trail" except yourself, making it a tool for personal growth and tracking rather than social recommendation.

I intend to soon round the service out with an spreadsheet exporting tool, liberating the data so that anyone can share it with whoever they want, or back up their reading history explicitly or automatically.
