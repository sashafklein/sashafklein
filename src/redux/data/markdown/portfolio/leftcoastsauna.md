Two friends and I founded [Left Coast Sauna](https://leftcoastsauna.com) in 2016, hoping to bring sauna culture to the Bay Area and "build community through sweat." We built out our first offering -- a 6-person, 13-ft-long cedar barrel sauna -- affixed it to a trailer, upgraded to a 40,000-BTU propane furnace, and drive it around for pop-ups and events around the Bay Area.

Our mobile sauna has been a blast to share and has built a significant weekly following in Noe Valley, where we run a weekly street-side pop-up. Most exciting for me, the community we were aiming to create has coalesced around the sauna pop-ups, where a sizable group of regulars from the greater Noe area comes by every week to sweat it out and hang with the sauna community.
