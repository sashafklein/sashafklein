As the Covid-19 crisis picked up steam, my brother and I became concerned that immune status could become used by over-zealous centralized governments to dictate who could return to work or access core services like transit. Seeking to avoid a series of [Chinese Social Credit System-like](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Social_Credit_System) tools popping up worldwide, we partnered with a group of volunteers to build out an [open-source and highly secure system](https://imsafehealth.com/mission/) for the voluntary sharing of immune or infection status.

As of May 2020, the research on both immunity and testing is insufficiently conclusive to support this tool, and it looks likely that the world will continue to open up without a restrictive "Immunity Passport." Based on a large number of conversations with healthcare officials, entrepreneurs, and biostatisticians, we've refocused on an open tool to help doctors and patients apply Bayesian analysis to better interpret testing and get a more conclusive sense of whether they have the virus, have recovered from it, or are shedding.
