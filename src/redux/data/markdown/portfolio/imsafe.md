As the Covid-19 crisis picked up steam, my brother and I became concerned that immune status could become a gating factor for future employment and physical movement. We wanted to make sure that if immunity became a necessary condition of work or travel, it was shared privately, securely, and voluntarily, rather than tracked centrally by world government systems similar to the [Chinese Social Credit System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Social_Credit_System).

We partnered with a group of volunteers to build out an [open-source and highly secure system](https://imsafehealth.com/mission/) for the voluntary sharing of immune or infection status. As of May 2020, the research on both immunity and testing is insufficiently conclusive to support this tool, and it thankfully looks likely that the world will continue to open up without restrictive "Immunity Passports" or a future defined by government control of movement and employment.

With the virus continuing to spread and devastate communities, however, and with dependable data remaining illusive, we pivoted to build out a tool that we felt would help individuals contextualize and understand their testing results (currently just in the US).

Based on a number of conversations with healthcare officials, entrepreneurs, and biostatisticians, we focused on building out [a lightweight web app](bayes.imsafehealth.com) to help doctors and patients apply Bayesian analysis to better interpret testing and get a more conclusive sense of whether they have the virus, have recovered from it, or are shedding.
