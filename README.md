# RS React Redux Starter

This app is based off of [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit), which provides all the core technologies for our app, including:

- React
- Redux
- Webpack with Hot Loader
- Karma/Mocha for testing
- SCSS/PostCSS
- Eslint

### Getting started

To build locally:

```
npm install
npm dev
```

To deploy to Heroku, simply commit the code and run:

```
git push heroku master
```

Which will deploy the code, compile it, and run the server.

To run tests or lint:

```
npm run test
npm run lint
```

For more information on the architectural thinking, check out the [starter kit repo](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) or read this [intro article](https://suspicious.website/2016/04/29/starting-out-with-react-redux-starter-kit/).

## Development

This app uses Redux DevTools out of the box, so install [Redux DevTools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) if you want to use them.

Webpack is configured to make use of [resolve.root](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-root), which lets you import local packages as if you were traversing from the root of your `~/src` directory. Here's an example:

```js
// current file: ~/src/views/some/nested/View.js
// What used to be this:
import SomeComponent from '../../../components/SomeComponent'

// Can now be this:
import SomeComponent from 'components/SomeComponent' // Hooray!
```

### Globals

These are global variables available to you anywhere in your source code. If you wish to modify them, they can be found as the `globals` key in `~/config/project.config.js`. When adding new globals, make sure you also add them to `~/.eslintrc`.

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|`process.env.NODE_ENV`|the active `NODE_ENV` when the build started|
|`__DEV__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development`|
|`__PROD__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `production`|
|`__TEST__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `test`|

#### How we adapted this to deploy on Heroku

Loosely following the instructions [here](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/FAQ:-Frequently-Asked-Questions), we adapted this for Heroku deployment by taking the following steps:

- Replaced/added the following commands in `package.json`:

```
...
"start": "better-npm-run start:prod",
"serve": "better-npm-run start",
"postinstall": "npm run deploy:prod",
"betterScripts": {
  ...
  "deploy:prod": {
    "command": "npm run clean && npm run compile",
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production",
      "DEBUG": "app:*"
    }
  },
  "start:prod": {
    "command": "node bin/server",
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production"
    }
  }
  ...
},
```

- Added a `bin/server` file (equivalent to `bin/dev-server`, except without the `debug` import or usage -- used `console.info` instead).
- Ran `heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false` to make sure Heroku installs necessary dev dependencies such as `express` etc.
