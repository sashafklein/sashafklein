<p><strong>Well, hi there!</strong></p>

<p>My name's Sasha Klein. I'm a freelance web developer and dilettante, excited to keep learning and creating online. I started web development with <%= link_to "Bloc", "www.bloc.io" %>, an intensive, online Ruby-on-Rails bootcamp, where I worked with a cohort and several mentors to cover the basics of Ruby, HTML, CSS, Rails, Javascript and more, and turn that knowledge into a functional final-project.</p>

<div class="black_links">
	<%= image_tag('headshot.png', class: "port_photo right_photo", id: "headshot", alt: "Me") %>
</div>

<p>Mine, <%= link_to "MeatUp", 'portfolio#meatup' %>, ended up turning into both a mammoth one-man coding project and an introductory course to start ups, as I tried to turn my learning project into a functional real-world solution to the complications of buying whole-animal meat directly from a farmer.</p>

<p>Before coding -- a fairly recent development in my life -- I was <%= link_to "teaching and college counseling in Shanghai", 'portfolio#china' %> and, before that, studying English Lit in Boston and odd jobbing around the world.</p>

<p>I love tackling new, complicated problems, and would love to hear about yours. If you've got a web project that needs coding, get in touch, either through <%= link_to "ODesk", 'https://www.odesk.com/users/~01e74747c979a7bfd6' %> or by <%= link_to "shooting me an email", '#email' %>.</p>
