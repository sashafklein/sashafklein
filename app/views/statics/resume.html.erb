				<p class="blue_links"><%= link_to "Bloc", "https://www.bloc.io" %> is an online web-development boot camp that turns a small cohort of students into well-versed web developers over the course of 2-3 intensive months.</p>

				<p>A faculty of "mentor" coders guides us through <em>Ruby</em>, <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>Git</em>, <em>Rails</em>, <em>RSpec</em> testing, <em>Javascript/JQuery</em>, and more. The learning is focused through, and culminates in, a final project of our own design.</p>

				<p>Bloc got my developing feet wet and helped teach me how to teach myself to tackle any coding obstacle thrown my way.</p>

					<p>After four years of debating which major to choose -- mostly torn between Psychology, Econ, Film, and English Lit -- I decided on the least relevant and graduated with an honors English degree and a screenplay for a thesis in May of 2011.</p>
					<p>As a consequence, my undergraduate education has very little to do with my development work, but I feel the four years I spent studying, volunteering, and working instilled in me an excitement about learning that has translated neatly into web development.</p>
					<p>Bloc aside, all of my development knowledge has been self-taught, and I credit both Bloc and college with turning me into a more effective learner, and, by extension, developer.</p>
