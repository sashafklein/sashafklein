          is an online web-development apprenticeship that turns a small group of students into well-versed web developers over the course of 2-3 intensive months.

            %p After four years of debating which major to choose -- mostly torn between Psychology, Econ, Film, and English Lit -- I decided on the least relevant and graduated with an honors English degree and a screenplay for a thesis in May of 2011.
            %p As a consequence, my undergraduate education has very little to do with my development work, but I feel the four years I spent studying, volunteering, and working instilled in me an excitement about learning that has translated neatly into web development.
            %p Bloc aside, all of my development knowledge has been self-taught, and I credit both Bloc and college with turning me into a more effective learner, and, by extension, developer.
